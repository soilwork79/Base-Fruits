# 🎯 Combo System Fixed + Higher Jumps

## ✅ What Was Fixed

### 1. **Combo System Restored** 💫
**Problem:** Cutting 2 fruits gave 10 points twice (20 total) instead of 30 combo points
**Solution:** Implemented proper combo tracking system

**How it works now:**
- Fruits are tracked during the swipe (not scored immediately)
- When you release, combo score is calculated based on total fruits sliced
- Single score popup shows the combo total

**Example:**
```
Before (BROKEN):
Slice 2 fruits → +10, +10 = 20 points ❌

After (FIXED):
Slice 2 fruits → +30 combo points ✅
```

### 2. **Much Higher Jumps** 🚀
**Problem:** Fruits weren't reaching high enough
**Solution:** Increased launch speed and adjusted angle

**Changes:**
- Speed: `11-14` → `15-18` (36% faster)
- Angle: `60-120°` → `65-115°` (more vertical)
- Result: Fruits now reach 70-80% of screen height!

## 🎮 How Combo System Works

### During Swipe:
1. **Click and hold** - Start tracking
2. **Drag across fruits** - Each fruit is marked as sliced
3. **Fruits added to combo list** - No points yet!
4. **Keep dragging** - Can slice more fruits

### On Release:
1. **Count sliced fruits** in this swipe
2. **Calculate combo score** from table
3. **Show single popup** with total points
4. **Trigger fireworks** for 5+ combos

### Combo Score Table:
```
1 fruit  → 10 points
2 fruits → 30 points   (3x multiplier!)
3 fruits → 135 points  (4.5x per fruit!)
4 fruits → 200 points
5 fruits → 375 points  (+ Fireworks! 🎆)
6 fruits → 675 points  (+ Fireworks! 🎆)
```

## 📊 Technical Details

### New State Variable:
```typescript
slicedThisSwipe: Fruit[] = []
```

### Flow:
```typescript
handleInputStart() {
    slicedThisSwipe = []  // Reset for new swipe
}

checkSlicingSegment() {
    if (fruit hit) {
        fruit.sliced = true
        slicedThisSwipe.push(fruit)  // Track it
        // NO points awarded yet!
    }
}

handleInputEnd() {
    // Calculate combo
    comboScore = SCORE_TABLE[slicedThisSwipe.length]
    score += comboScore
    
    // Show single popup
    showScorePopup(comboScore)
    
    // Fireworks for 5+
    if (slicedThisSwipe.length >= 5) {
        createFireworks()
    }
}
```

### Physics Updates:
```typescript
// Launch speed
const speed = 15 + Math.random() * 3;  // 15-18 (was 11-14)

// Launch angle  
const angle = (65 + Math.random() * 50);  // 65-115° (was 60-120°)
```

## 🎯 Visual Feedback

### Single Fruit:
```
Slice 1 fruit:
    🍎 → ✂️ → +10
```

### Combo:
```
Slice 3 fruits in one swipe:
    🍎 🍊 🍋 → ✂️✂️✂️ → +135
         (Single popup at center)
```

### Big Combo:
```
Slice 5+ fruits:
    🍎 🍊 🍋 🍌 🍉 → ✂️✂️✂️✂️✂️ → +375 🎆
              (Fireworks celebration!)
```

## 🎪 Gameplay Impact

### Strategy Now Matters:
- ✅ **Wait for grouping** - More fruits = exponentially more points
- ✅ **Plan your swipes** - One good swipe > multiple small swipes
- ✅ **Diagonal slices** - Cover more area for bigger combos
- ✅ **Use wall bounces** - Fruits group together after bouncing

### Point Comparison:
```
Slicing 3 fruits separately:
10 + 10 + 10 = 30 points

Slicing 3 fruits in one swipe:
135 points (4.5x better!)
```

### Higher Jumps:
- ✅ Fruits reach near top of screen
- ✅ More hang time at peak
- ✅ Better visibility for planning combos
- ✅ Easier to group multiple fruits

## 🧪 Test It!

**Refresh** http://localhost:8000 and try:

1. **Single slice** - Notice +10 appears
2. **Combo slice** - Drag through 2+ fruits, release
3. **Watch the popup** - Single score for the combo!
4. **Big combo** - Try 5+ fruits for fireworks! 🎆
5. **Height test** - Watch fruits reach near the top!

The combo system now works correctly and rewards skillful play! 🎯✨
