# 🎯 Physics Update - Better Fruit Behavior!

## What Changed

### 1. 🚀 Much Higher Jumps
**Before:** Fruits barely reached 1/3 of screen height
**After:** Fruits now reach near the top of the screen!

- Increased launch speed: `10-14` → `14-18`
- Reduced gravity: `0.3` → `0.25` (slower fall)
- Result: Fruits climb much higher with better arc visibility

### 2. 🎪 Wall Bouncing
**New Feature:** Fruits now bounce off left and right walls!

- Fruits that hit walls bounce back with 70% velocity
- No more fruits flying off-screen horizontally
- Creates more interesting gameplay patterns
- Gives you more chances to slice

### 3. 📐 Reduced Horizontal Spread
**Before:** Fruits launched from 20-80% of screen width
**After:** Fruits launch from 30-70% (more centered)

- Launch angle: `50-130°` → `60-120°` (more vertical)
- Horizontal position: `0.2-0.8` → `0.3-0.7` (more centered)
- Result: Less extreme horizontal movement

### 4. 🐌 Even Slower Movement
**Gravity reduced again:** `0.3` → `0.25`

- Fruits stay in air longer
- More time to plan your slices
- Better for combo opportunities

## Technical Details

### Constants:
```typescript
// Physics
const GRAVITY = 0.25;              // Was 0.3, now 17% slower
const WALL_BOUNCE_DAMPING = 0.7;   // NEW: 70% velocity after bounce

// Launch parameters
const speed = 14 + Math.random() * 4;     // 14-18 (was 10-14)
const angle = (60 + Math.random() * 60);  // 60-120° (was 50-130°)
const x = width * (0.3 + Math.random() * 0.4); // 30-70% (was 20-80%)
```

### Wall Bounce Logic:
```typescript
// Left wall
if (fruit.x - fruit.radius < 0) {
    fruit.x = fruit.radius;
    fruit.vx = Math.abs(fruit.vx) * 0.7;  // Bounce right
}

// Right wall
if (fruit.x + fruit.radius > width) {
    fruit.x = width - fruit.radius;
    fruit.vx = -Math.abs(fruit.vx) * 0.7; // Bounce left
}
```

## Visual Comparison

### Before:
```
Top     [                    ]
        [                    ]
Mid     [    🍎         🍊   ]  ← Fruits barely reached here
        [                    ]
Bottom  [        🍋          ]  ← Launch point
```

### After:
```
Top     [    🍎    🍊        ]  ← Fruits reach near top!
        [         🍋         ]
Mid     [                    ]
        [  ↔️ Bounces off    ]  ← Wall bouncing
Bottom  [      Launch        ]  ← More centered
```

## Gameplay Impact

✅ **Higher jumps** = Better visibility and more reaction time
✅ **Wall bouncing** = More chances to slice, no off-screen escapes
✅ **Centered launch** = Less extreme horizontal movement
✅ **Slower gravity** = Longer hang time for combos

## Test It!

Refresh http://localhost:8000 and notice:

1. **Fruits jump much higher** - reaching near the top
2. **Fruits bounce off walls** - watch them ricochet!
3. **More vertical movement** - less wild horizontal spread
4. **Slower overall** - easier to track and slice

The game is now much more playable and satisfying! 🍉✨
