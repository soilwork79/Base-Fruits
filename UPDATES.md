# ðŸŽ® Game Updates - Physics & Layout

## Changes Made

### ðŸŽ¯ Physics Improvements

**Slower, Higher Fruit Movement:**
- âœ… Reduced gravity from `0.4` to `0.3` (30% slower fall)
- âœ… Reduced launch speed from `12-18` to `10-14` (slower initial velocity)
- âœ… Changed launch angle from `45-135Â°` to `50-130Â°` (higher arc)
- âœ… Result: Fruits now climb higher and move slower, easier to slice!

### ðŸ“± Responsive Layout

**Desktop (Browser):**
- âœ… Max-width: 500px (centered, phone-like view)
- âœ… Dark background on sides
- âœ… Subtle shadow for depth
- âœ… Much easier to play - fruits stay in reachable area

**Mobile/Farcaster (â‰¤768px):**
- âœ… Full-screen (100% width)
- âœ… No max-width constraint
- âœ… Edge-to-edge display
- âœ… Perfect for Farcaster mini app format

## Before vs After

### Physics:
**Before:**
- Gravity: 0.4
- Speed: 12-18
- Angle: 45-135Â°
- Result: Fast, wide spread

**After:**
- Gravity: 0.3 (25% slower)
- Speed: 10-14 (slower)
- Angle: 50-130Â° (higher)
- Result: Slower, higher arcs, easier to slice

### Layout:
**Before:**
- Desktop: Full screen width (too wide)
- Mobile: Full screen width

**After:**
- Desktop: Max 500px centered (phone-like)
- Mobile: Full screen width (unchanged)

## Test It!

1. Refresh http://localhost:8000
2. Desktop: Notice the centered, narrower game area
3. Resize window < 768px: See it go full-screen
4. Play: Fruits move slower and climb higher!

## Why These Changes?

1. **Slower fruits** = More time to react and slice
2. **Higher arcs** = More predictable trajectories
3. **Narrower desktop view** = Easier to reach all fruits
4. **Full-screen mobile** = Perfect for Farcaster

The game now plays great on both desktop browsers AND mobile/Farcaster! ðŸŽ‰
