# 🔊 Sound System Updated - Instant Feedback!

## ✅ What Changed

**Before:** Sounds played when releasing mouse button
**After:** Sounds play **instantly** when each fruit is cut!

### Simplified to 3 Sound Types:

#### 1. **First Fruit** 🍎
- **Frequency:** 800 Hz
- **Duration:** 0.1 seconds (short)
- **When:** When you slice the 1st fruit

#### 2. **2nd-4th Fruit** 🍎🍊🍋🍌
- **Frequency:** 1000 Hz
- **Duration:** 0.2 seconds (slightly longer)
- **When:** When you slice the 2nd, 3rd, or 4th fruit in one swipe

#### 3. **5th-6th Fruit** 🍎🍊🍋🍌🍉🍇
- **Frequency:** 1200 Hz
- **Duration:** 0.35 seconds (much longer)
- **When:** When you slice the 5th or 6th fruit in one swipe

## 🎵 How It Works

### Real-Time Sound:
```
Drag across fruits:
